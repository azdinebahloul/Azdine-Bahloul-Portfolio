# My Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases the projects I have worked on during my data analysis learning adventure, as well as a personal project that I have undertaken to practice new methods and tools.

# Why HTML & JavaScript?
I decided to build this portfolio using HTML and JavaScript for several reasons:

- **Learning Opportunity** : Building my portfolio in HTML and JavaScript provided me with a valuable learning experience. It allowed me to delve into new programming languages independently and gain hands-on practice. HTML is a fundamental language in web development, and JavaScript enhances the interactivity and functionality of web pages.

- **Showcasing Projects**: HTML and JavaScript offer a versatile and customizable platform to showcase my projects effectively. By leveraging HTML and JavaScript, I was able to present my work in an organized and visually appealing manner. This allows potential employers or collaborators to easily navigate through my projects and understand their scope and impact.

- **Widely Used Languages**: HTML and JavaScript are widely used in web development. By choosing HTML and JavaScript for my portfolio, I acquired skills that are valuable across various industries and disciplines. This opens up opportunities to collaborate on web-based projects and demonstrates my ability to work with commonly used web technologies.
